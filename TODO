* port operational report to use new outage spec
* input sh scripts work with flex schema. maybe below tags all key=val pairs or somehing
* make edit work properly again with vimeo plugin / schema extensions, maybe even based on tag etc (matching rules) attach validation rules
* make analytics csv/table work
* after an operation like add/edit/delete properly show feedback without having to time.sleep because we wait for elasticsearch to sync
* fix time display in timeline (must be local time)
* look into logstash integration points
* better search/querying
* elasticsearch backups
* form support for "optional key:value fields", so that we can discourage key=val tags. add support in generic add form, and the *.sh scripts
(not in marketing form, maybe in engineering/anal forms too). maybe we can always automatically turn 'key=value' tags into fields.
* better reorganize links: 
  * move json/xml/... to separate menu, they don't need to be so explicit, people rarely need these links.
  * some menu items from plugins should integrate with other menu items (i.e. /events/add/foo should be just below /events/add)
