* show optional fields in table view (or maybe a button to go to detailed view)
* port operational report to use new outage spec
* updates in ES not visible right away. (i.e. after edit returning to table shows outdated version)
* after an operation like add/edit/delete in the interface, go to something more sensible (i.e. previous page)
* after an operation like add/edit/delete properly show feedback without having to time.sleep because we wait for elasticsearch to sync
* fix time display in timeline (must be local time)
* look into logstash integration points
* better search/querying
* elasticsearch backups
