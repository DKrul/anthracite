* show optional fields in table view (or maybe a button to go to detailed view)
* port operational report to use new outage spec
* updates in ES not visible right away. (i.e. after edit returning to table shows outdated version)
* after an operation like add/edit/delete in the interface, go to something more sensible (i.e. previous page)
* after an operation like add/edit/delete properly show feedback without having to time.sleep because we wait for elasticsearch to sync
* fix time display in timeline (must be local time)
* look into logstash integration points
* better search/querying
* elasticsearch backups
* form support for "optional key:value fields", so that we can discourage key=val tags. add support in generic add form, and the *.sh scripts
(not in marketing form, maybe in engineering/anal forms too). maybe we can always automatically turn 'key=value' tags into fields.
* better reorganize links: 
  * move json/xml/... to separate menu, they don't need to be so explicit, people rarely need these links.
  * some menu items from plugins should integrate with other menu items (i.e. /events/add/foo should be just below /events/add)
